<strong>How the app works:</strong>

  * There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

  * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

  * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

  * game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.

  * When they do click one, will update the player's score counter.

  * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

  * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

  * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
